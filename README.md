```  


<br>

# API Keys üîë

- It's **not an obligation** to pay for a **Hacker Target** API key, you can leave it how it is, just choose the free search by typing  `-F` each time the tool asks you to choose between the Free search and the search using your API key.
- It's an **obligation** ‚úÖ to get yourself a **WhoisXML** Api key, this is free (`500 searches free`), just go to the WhoisXML website and get an account to get your API key: (https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com)
- It's also an **obligation** ‚úÖ to get yourself a **WhoisFreaks** Api key, this is free (`100 searches free`), just go to the WhoisFreaks website and sign up to get your API key: (https://whoisfreaks.com), and by the way, once your 100 free searches are used, you can purchase 5000 API Calls for only 19,00$ USD
